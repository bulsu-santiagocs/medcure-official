## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine (v20.19.0 or higher is recommended). This will include `npm`.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bulsu-santiagocs/medcure-official.git
